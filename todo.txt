- Integrate with funding matrix
-   Pencil out how to handle percentage funding amounts for a variable purchase price
-   Calc out second funding matrix function
-   Use the funding matrix functions in the Solver
-   Determine if there are other use cases to utilize the funding matrix and what functions they would be

- Solved values should probably be stored in state so I don't have to solve in several different views...
- Last column needs to take into account that some of the values may be solved already
- Re-add the ability to switch amount types
- Integrate number formatting on first column





//TODO:
  If there are multiple parameters that are requirements, need to run multiple times with each minima/maxima
    and select the option that satisfies all of them. If no solution satisfies all requirements,
    notify the user that they will have to change parameters
  Need to integrate with funding matrix...
  Funding matrix usage breakdown

  To solve funding matrix:
    try entire first funding option. If that is too much money, then it should be a calculus (or perhaps arithmetic?)
      equation to find out where the stop point is on the line
    if it is not enough money, save that amount and try the next funding option + the entire accumulated amount

// My current use case is...
//  I want to enter exact #s for Net Rent, Repairs, HOA, PropMan, Rep/Main, CapEx, Vacancy, Taxes, Insurance, Other expenses/income
//  I want to enter minimum #s for CoCRoI, ProfitPerMonth
//  I want to see exact #s for max purchase price, CoCRoI, ProfitPerMonth, NOI, Operating expenses, CapRate


// Solution user flow 1:
//  I want to first decide which parameters I want to see exact numbers for (Looks like a list of names and checkboxes)
//  Then I want to decide which parameters I want to enter minimum/maximum numbers for (These can only be selected from those checked off in step 1)
//  Then I want to be told what numbers I need to fill in

// Solution user flow 2:
//  I check the boxes for which parameters I want to see exact numbers for
//  The textboxes I need to fill in to derive that number are marked as such
//   and/or have tooltips that give options for what combinations can be filled out to derive them
